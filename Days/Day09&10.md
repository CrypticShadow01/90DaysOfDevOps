## Setting up website on CentOs7 

Things I used to launch a website on my CentOs7 Vm:
1. Vagrant - Provisioning and managing VM.
2. httpd service - Server
3. An HtML Template.

##  Let's do this.

Create a directory where we will be doing our vagrant box setup:

After that I find a centos7 box, you can simply go to [Vagrant Official Site](vagrantup.com/) and search for the box I need:

Then I copied the box name and run init command:

> vagrant init centos/7

It created a Vagrantfile for me from which my VM will get all its network, memory and provisioning information.

I go to that vagrant file using command :
> code . Vagrantfile

and edited some network settings which will allow my VM to get a Dynamic IP as well as I assign it a Static IP too.

>Note : Assign an Statis IP different from any other previous VM IP.

As I am doing in manually I do not have to provide provisioning with scripts althought I did it later.

Now, just simply SSH into your VM by using :
> vagrant up

amd then 

> vagrant ssh

After vagrant up command you will see this environments setting configuring for your vm:

Once you SSH you will see this :

Now all we have to do is install an httpd service and host our site in it.

Be the root user,command for this is :

> sudo -i
"#" is a symbol for root user.

Run this command:

> yum isntall httpd -y 

yum :- Yellow dog Updater, Modified (Yum) is the default package manager used in CentOS ( all versions ). It is used to install and update packages from CentOS (and 3rd party) Repositories.

You will get to see something like this after succesful installation:

Check if the service is installed or not by running this command:

After you can simply go to any site and download a HTML template. I am using [tooplate.com](https://www.tooplate.com/)

I will not mention how to donwload and extract the zip its quite an easy process.

But before check your httpd service is running or not bu running this command:

> systemctl status httpd

If its running you can simply go to your Statis IP you set for your VM and see a default Httpd service page.

If it is inactie you can simply start it by 'systemctl start httpd'

I have automated it too by giving all the command in a startup-script itself will talk about it later.
After that extracting your zip file you can simply paste it inside ' /var/www/html' directory and it will be shown in the site.

Here is how the site looks now:
