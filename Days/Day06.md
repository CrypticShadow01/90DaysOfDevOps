After understaning the directory structure and some basic commands I want to take a step bcak as the course does not actually talks much about the flavour of Linux and what is open source in general.

So, today I leaned about what **Open Source** is and how once can be a part of it and also read about various Linux flavours and editors.

## What is Open Source?

Whenever we talk about **Open Source** in general what we mean by it is that something that is accessible publicly and does not need anyone's permission to do so. That is exactly what **Open Source Software** means:

> Open source software is code that is designed to be publicly accessibleâ€”anyone can see, modify, and distribute the code as they see fit.

These free/open source software provides 4 foundatoional freedom which are:

1. To run the program for any purpose.
2. To study, analyse and even modiy the source code (ofcourse, you need to get the approval from the commuity for that)
3. To redistribute the program
4. To create further derivatives program from it.

## Why Linux is Important in this Journey?

There are several reason for that, some of them are:

1. Open Source
2. Community Support
3. Heavily Customizable
4. Most server runs on Linux
5. Automations Options
6. Scripts
7. Security 
8. Most DevOps Tools implemented on LINUX only.

Now, that we understood the importance of Linux and how helpful it is for this journey. Let me share with you the different LINUX distro(distributiion):

### Popular Desktop Linux:

1. Ubuntu
2. Linux Mint
3. Arch
4. Fedora
5. Debian
6. OpenSuse

### Popula Server Linux

1. Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)
2. Ubuntu Server
3. Centos
4. Suse Enterprise Linux.
