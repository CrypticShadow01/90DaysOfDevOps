## Understanding Linux

Today, I proceed with the course and spin up some VM and deployed an apache server too. Afte that I started the 'Understanding Linux' module and rest of the day I spent understanding Linux File system and architecture.

Started with the Imtroduction of the man himself [Linus Torvalds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds) and his contribution to the open source community.
It's great to see how brilliant minds around the globe come together to build somehing and learn with it too.

Then I learnt some **Basic Principles** of Linux. Have written it down and will share notes here too, forgive me for my handwriting thou:

After that understood one of the most basic and probably the modt important concept of Linux which is ** Linux File System ** :

This site has a very great explanation on all the directories and their usage:

Alongside this leaned about the basic Linux commands which are:
>mv, cp , pwd , whoami , rm , clear , sudo etc.

It wasn't the most prodcutive day but I enjoyed it and also found some great Youtube Channels as well will share that too soon.
