## Day 01- Learnings

I started with my Udemy Course 'DevOps beginner to Advance' where I understand the real definition of **DevOps**. Devops is an idealogy which allow us to leverage certain tools in order to make the Software development lifecycle smooth and efficient. In simple terms, it is a method of making a siftware development cycle smooth and reduce the overhead of back and forth.

Installed variety of tools and software in which I will be working on for some time:

1. VirtualBox
2. Chocolatey
3. GitBash
4. Vagrant
5. AWS CLI
6. Gcloud SDK

Learnt alot about **Vagrant** and how to use it in order to Built and manage your VMs from command line. Wrote a blog about it too, Here it is -
