After understaning various Linux ditro and how much Linux is important for us to continue learning DevOps I continue going deeper in the topic.

Past 2 days I am using Linux and getting myself familiar with the commands and Linux shell.

Here are some of the very basic commands that we will be using everytime throughout this journey.

> pwd -> Present Working Directory

> mkdir ➔ Create a directory/folder in your home directory

> cd xyz/ ➔ Change your current working directory to xyz

> ls ➔  List files and directories inside current directory

> touch ➔ Create a empty file

> mv ➔ Moving files from one location to another

> rm ➔ Removing files and directories.

> whoami ➔ Shows the name of current user

> id ➔ Shows the user details.

Alongside this there are many more commands and options are also there to make a specific things happen.

> -i ➔ Ignore Case

> -r ➔ For directory related work

> -f ➔ Files related commands.

and many more....

## What is path in Linux file system?
A path is a unique location to a file or a folder in a file system of an OS. A path to a file is
a combination of / and alpha-numeric characters.

There are 2 types of path :

#### Absolute Path:

An absolute path is defined as the specifying the location of a file or directory from the root
directory(/). In other words we can say absolute path is a complete path from start of actual
filesystem from / directory.

#### Relative path:

Relative path is defined as path related to the present working directory(pwd). Suppose I am located
in /home/imran and I want to change directory to /home/imran/linux-practices. I can use relative
path concept to change directory to linux-practices and also devopsdir directory

After getting a hang of these commands I move further and read about the editors:

1. vim
2. nano
3. vi

I absolutely loved 'vim' so I isntalled vim and started playing with its command.

Here I am attaching a table I get from my **Udem Course** about vim commands and modes:

Last two days was very productive setup and understood AWS free tier account and spin up some VMs as well. Will talk about it in later days. Hope you find it helpful , byee byee.
