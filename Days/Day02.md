DevOps and everywhere now, whenever I open twitter soneone or the other are using this #xdaysofDevOps so as an Engineer from the same domain , I got very curious and started searching for resources to learn and understand this profile **DevOps Engineer**.

## What is DevOps?
DevOps is the combination of cultural philosophies, practices, and tools that increases an organizationâ€™s ability to deliver applications and services at high velocity: evolving and improving products at a faster pace than organizations using traditional software development and infrastructure management processes. This speed enables organizations to better serve their customers and compete more effectively in the market

## How DevOps works?
One thing I keep hearing in this methodology is that in this model, development and operations teams are no longer an isolated team from one another.Sometimes, these two teams are merged into a single team where the engineers work across the entire application lifecycle, from development and test to deployment to operations, and develop a range of skills not limited to a single function.

In some DevOps models, quality assurance and security teams may also become more tightly integrated with development and operations and throughout the application lifecycle. When security is the focus of everyone on a DevOps team, this is sometimes referred to as **DevSecOps**(second mosr heard profile).

## What are the benefits that a DevOps model has:

1.Speed:- Move at high velocity so you can innovate for customers faster, adapt to changing markets better, and grow more efficient at driving business results. This can be achieved by CI/CD.

2. Reliability:- Ensure the quality of application updates and infrastructure changes so you can reliably deliver at a more rapid pace while maintaining a positive experience for end users. Use practices like continuous integration and continuous delivery to test that each change is functional and safe. 

3. Security:- Move quickly while retaining control and preserving compliance. You can adopt a DevOps model without sacrificing security by using automated compliance policies, fine-grained controls, and configuration management techniques. For example, using infrastructure as code and policy as code, you can define and then track compliance at scale.

## Some of the best DevOps practices include:

1. CI(Continous Integration).
2. CD(Continous Delivery).
3. Microservices.
4. IAAC(Infrastructure as a code)
5. Logging and Monitoring.

I don't actually know any of them but in this journey I want to learn them all. Also, There is this diagram which explains **DevOps** Lifecycle:
