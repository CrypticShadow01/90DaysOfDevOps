# 90DaysOfDevOps
In this repository I am gong to document my DevOps learnings. I will also be sharing resources and roadmaps for the same. I am starting this journey from 8th of March and will try to complete it in 90 days.

I love to share my knowledge and want to learn at the same time from the community as well. 

I will be giving at least 1-1.5 hours a day towards this and will try to share as much as possible throughout this journey.
